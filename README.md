 Monte carlo simulation on S&P 500 fortunes
Starting with pv (present value) and investing an additional (10000) anually, what is the probability that you will have atleast 1,000,000 after investing in s&p 500 etf.


The Monte Carlo model allows researchers to run multiple trials and define all potential outcomes of an event or investment. Together, they create a probability distribution or risk assessment for a given investment or event.


Monte Carlo analysis is a multivariate modeling technique.All multivariate models can be thought of as complex "what if?" scenarios. Research analysts use them to forecast investment outcomes, to understand the possibilities surrounding their investment exposures, and to better mitigate risks. In the Monte Carlo method, the results are compared against risk tolerance. That helps a manager decide whether to proceed with an investment or project
